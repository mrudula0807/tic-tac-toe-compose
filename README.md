# Tic Tac Toe - Jetpack Compose
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game built using Jetpack Compose. This project is an example of how to create a simple yet interactive mobile game using modern Android development techniques. The game supports single-player mode where the user plays against an AI with an optimized algorithm.

## Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project demonstrates how to implement a complete game using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. The app features intuitive game mechanics, a clean user interface, animations, and a responsive design that handles configuration changes seamlessly.

## Features
* Single-Player Mode: Play against a smart AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
* Interactive UI: Built with Jetpack Compose for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
* Winning Line Animation: Highlights the winning line when a player wins the game.
* Reset Functionality: Allows players to reset the game and start over.
* Configurations Handling: Maintains game state during configuration changes like screen rotation and dark mode.

## Technologies Used
* Kotlin: Primary language for Android development.
* Jetpack Compose: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces.
* Android ViewModel: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
